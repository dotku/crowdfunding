An affortable group booking service that could lower down the travel cost

1. The travler could stay for 3 months to 1 year (2 weeks minimum stays)
2. The travler could pay by location pass or membership, e.g., if the traveler did the South America option then they could stay 1 month in Brazil, Colombia and Argentina.
3. These places are  chosen because they are cheap, safe, fun and good for our audience.
